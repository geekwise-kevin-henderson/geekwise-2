      <h3>NO</h3>
      <h4>Intro</h4>
      <p>
        Prop 63 makes legally buying and selling ammuntion more difficult. While doing nothing about the black market trading of ammunition that people will turn to to avoid jumping through the hoops created by this proposition, causing greater gang violence and more gang related deaths. The costs of this proposition are estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars annually, statewide. Which will be coming straight from the pockets of law-abiding, tax-paying Californians.
